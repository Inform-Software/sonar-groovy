## Description

This plugin enables analysis of Groovy within SonarQube.

It leverages [CodeNarc](http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/) to raise issues
against coding rules and [GMetrics](http://gmetrics.sourceforge.net/) for
cyclomatic complexity.

For code coverage, the SonarQube [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)
plugin should be used. Additionally, this plugin still supports importing
binary JaCoCo reports (deprecated, will be removed in the future) and
[Cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/).

Plugin    | 1.4/1.5 | 1.6     | 1.7
----------|---------|---------|-----
CodeNarc  | 0.25.2  | 1.4     | 1.4
GMetrics  | 0.7     | 1.0     | 1.0
SonarQube | 5.6-6.7 | 6.7-7.9 | 7.8-8.3

## Steps to Analyze a Groovy Project
1. Install SonarQube Server
1. Install SonarQube Scanner and be sure you can call `sonar-scanner` from the directory where you have your source code
1. Install the Groovy Plugin.
1. Create a _sonar-project.properties_ file at the root of your project
1. Run `sonar-scanner` command from the project root dir
1. Follow the link provided at the end of the analysis to browse your project's quality in SonarQube UI

## Notes

*CodeNarc*: It is possible to reuse a previously generated report from CodeNarc
by setting the `sonar.groovy.codenarc.reportPaths` property.

*Groovy File Suffixes*: It is possible to define multiple groovy file suffixes
to be recognized by setting the `sonar.groovy.file.suffixes` property. Note
that by default, only files having `.groovy` as extension will be analyzed.

*Unit Tests Execution Reports*: Import unit tests execution reports (JUnit XML
format) by setting the sonar.junit.reportsPath property. Default location is
_target/surefire-reports_.

*JaCoCo and Binaries*: The groovy plugin requires access to source binaries
when analyzing JaCoCo reports. Consequently, property `sonar.groovy.binaries`
has to be configured for the analysis (comma-separated paths to binary
folders). For Maven and gradle projects, the property is automatically set.

## Coverage Results Import

The Groovy Plugin does not generate its own test coverage report, but re-uses
the ones generated by Cobertura or JaCoCo. 

### Code Coverage with Cobertura

To display code coverage data:

1. Prior to the SonarQube analysis, execute your unit tests and generate the
   Cobertura XML report.
1. Import this report while running the SonarQube analysis by setting the
   `sonar.groovy.cobertura.reportPath` property to the path to the Cobertura
   XML report. The path may be absolute or relative to the project base
   directory.

### Code Coverage with JaCoCo

To display code coverage data:

1. Prior to the SonarQube analysis, execute your tests and generate the JaCoCo
   exec file(s).
1. In order to be able to read the exec report file, and as JaCoCo bases its
   analysis on binaries, set the `sonar.groovy.binaries` property.
1. Set the `sonar.groovy.jacoco.reportPath` property to the path to the JaCoCo
   exec file related to your unit tests.
1. (Optional) If you are running integration tests on top of your unit tests,
   you may want to set the `sonar.groovy.jacoco.itReportPath` to the path to
   JaCoCo exec file related to the integration tests.
1. Run the SonarQube analysis.

## Contributions

Contributions via GitHub [issues] and pull requests are very welcome. This
project tries to adhere to the [Google Java Style], but we don't want a global
reformat to keep the Git history readable. To help with this, you can use the
[fmt-maven-plugin] to format your changes:

    mvn fmt:format -DfilesNamePattern=TestUtils\.java

You can use the `fileNamePattern` option to restrict the formatter to the files
you changed.

### Updating CodeNarc

In the directory `codenarc-converter` there is a little helper tool to convert
CodeNarc rules to SonarQube rules. To do its job it needs a source copy of
CodeNarc - this is currently achieved by including the used CodeNarc version as
a git subbmodule. If you need to update CodeNarc, you need to update that
submodule too:

```
git submodule init
cd codenarc-converter/CodeNarc
git checkout vX.Y.Z
cd ..
git add CodeNarc
```

You should then run the `codenarc-converter` (Running `mvn verify` should be
enough if the project is set up correctly) and merge descriptions from
`codenarc-converter/target/results/rules.xml` into
`sonar-groovy-plugin/src/main/resources/org/sonar/plugins/groovy/rules.xml`.
The converter does a pretty crude job converting CodeNarc's [APT] documentation
into SonarQube rule descriptions.
